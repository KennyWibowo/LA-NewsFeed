# LA-NewsFeed
News Feed App created at LA Hacks. We use the typical format of a RSS feed and Java in order to send specific
headline notifications to the android application. Presently, we have only configured the program to include sites from CNN 
though it is possible to add more feeds. The color of each news article indicates how "urgent" or important each news 
article is. We managed to do this from using the Bing Api to aquire specific data, importantly search results. The refresh 
button can be pressed to update the feed. Pressing one of the links sends the user to their appropriate browser with the 
intended link. In the future, we hopefully plan to find some sort of compatability with the smartwatch interface and improve on the core design of the application.
